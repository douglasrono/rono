                          Douglas is an amazing designer, and great to work with! I hired her to create a high-quality opt-in offer for my mailing list, and she quickly understood what I was looking for, and how to appeal to my somewhat complex market. She was efficient and supportive, asked great questions that helped me think through my offer, and brought great creativity and insight to the final product.

                          I am totally happy with it, and have already gotten good feedback! She also has a great sense of humour! Thanks so much, Douglas, it was really a pleasure!

                          We engaged Douglas as a consultant to review and critique the design of our website and marketing materials. She has been an excellent source of constructive feedback, and has helped us immensely to communicate our vision with visually compelling materials.

                          She understands our business well, asks good questions about our goals, and provides clear and detailed recommendations. I would highly recommend her services to any business wanting to understand and develop their visual brand.
